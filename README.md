This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

This project uses **Bun** as the preferred package manager for better performance.

First, install dependencies:

```bash
bun install
```

Then, run the development server:

```bash
bun run dev
# or alternatively
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

### Why Bun?

- ⚡ **Faster installs** - Up to 25x faster than npm
- 🔧 **Built-in bundler** - No need for separate build tools
- 🧪 **Native test runner** - Integrated testing with Vitest compatibility
- 📦 **Better monorepo support** - Superior workspace management

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

### Common Development Commands

```bash
# Development
bun run dev          # Start development server
bun run build        # Build for production
bun run build-no-lint # Build without linting (faster)
bun run start        # Start production server

# Testing
bun test             # Run unit tests
bun run storybook    # Start Storybook

# Package management
bun add <package>    # Add dependency
bun add -d <package> # Add dev dependency
bun update           # Update all packages
bun update <package> # Update specific package
```

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
